I've created this blog using [GitHub Pages] following [this excellent tutorial][GitHub Pages tutorial] for these reasons;

1. To remember. I love to learn but tend to forget things. The details surrounding short-lived obsessions of mine often get lost in the mires of my mind.
2. To exhibit. I love to be creative but tend to forget I've made something. These artefacts often get lost on my hard drive or in a sketchpad preventing me from iterating on them.
